    <p>
      From tinkering with hardware to building software, my passion for creation
      has always been my driving force. The pandemic sparked my journey into web
      development, and I haven't looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I bring several years of experience to the table, honed through
      internships at prominent YC-backed tech companies like <a

      and

      </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not tackling coding challenges, I find fulfillment in exploring
      new development tools, expanding my knowledge through reading, or staying
      active with kickboxing.
